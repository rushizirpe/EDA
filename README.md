This EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project on GitHub is aimed at providing an in-depth analysis of a given dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

This project is an excellent starting point for beginners in data analysis who want to learn how to visualize and understand a dataset's features, trends, and relationships.

The repository contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations of each step of the analysis process, making it easy for users to follow along and learn.

The EDA project covers essential topics such as data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering, and visualizations. By working through the notebooks, users will gain a solid foundation in data analysis and will be able to apply these skills to their own projects.

Contributions to this project are welcome, and users are encouraged to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.
